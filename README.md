# 🧂 Lada 

Lada is challenge for 2026 to create android app with jetpack compose and kotlin, 
several feature 

*EPIC 1*

- this app is language vocabulary learning english, germany and indonesian. 
- user can learn new range (2-15 or more) vocabulary with app 
- this app will use  wikdict dictionaries for database (its quite big about 1Gb for only germany)
- this app will use piper1 to pronouncing text into sound, it will say word at once and pronounce every character after it for example "eat now, e, a, t, , n, o, w"
- this app will make record and list word already learned by user.
- this app will have some challenge for user to guess and type word of a sound
- for EPIC 1 i dont care about user interface as long as it work, its ok, i will improve it on EPIC 2

## Note 

- use [alpha kotlin-lsp](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp) (its about 700Mb) instead [kotlin-language-server](https://github.com/fwcd/kotlin-language-server) alpha is working well compared to fwcd, to enable it use `vim.lsp.enable({"kotlin_lsp"})`
